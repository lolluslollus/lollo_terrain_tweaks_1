				[h2]This mod improves the looks of the terrain.[/h2]
				- It removes the dirt, which the stock game places along roads, pedestrian connections and stations.
				- It adds new paving textures.
				- It adds repaintable road station entrances.
				[h2]Dirt[/h2]
				Adjust the parameter \"Remove dirt\" to switch the dirt on or off. It can be true (no dirt, default) or false (leave the standard dirt in place).
				[h2]Modular road stations[/h2]
				To change the ground in a road station or its repaintable entries, press and hold <shift> and apply a \"paint tool\" asset.
				For the best road station looks (after 1925), leave the tarmac inside and apply a different paint tool in the corners outside the pavement.
