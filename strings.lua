				[h2]This mod removes the dirt, which the stock game places along roads, pedestrian connections and stations. It also adds new paving textures.[/h2]
				Adjust the file res/scripts/lollo_terrain_tweaks/settings.lua to switch the dirt on or off. The parameter \"removeDirt\" can be true (no dirt, default) or false (leave the dirt in place).
				[h2]Modular road stations[/h2]
				To change the ground in a road station or its repaintable entries, press and hold <shift> and apply a \"paint tool\" asset.
				For the best road station looks, leave the tarmac inside and apply a different paint tool in the corners outside the pavement.
