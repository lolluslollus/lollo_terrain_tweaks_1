[b]This is a mod to get rid of the dirt, which is in the stock game. It also adds new paving options.[/b]

[h2]The trouble: you make a country road, a street, a street station or you simply connect something and there is dirt around[/h2]
With this mod, streets and pedestrian connections will have no or very little dirt around.

[h2]Hint[/h2]
You may need to build a piece of road for this mod to become effective.

[h2]Road stations[/h2]
You will need to paint the terrain inside road stations, otherwise they will inherit the terrain they are placed upon.
